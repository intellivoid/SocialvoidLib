== User ID ==
A user ID format is a unique SHA256 hash, the algorithm behind it can be anything but must be uniquely random
in the network, hash conflicts against other netowrks are allowed because users can be from different networks,
eg; 'daf7dc335e4083ffd82f263aa0a3683746b488854935646484fe1d77babdba9f@socialvoid.cc' or 'netkas@socialvoid.cc'.
In both scenarios the user can be identified either by the hash ot username, some networks can be configured to
not allow resolutions via a user ID.

The formula used in SocialvoidLib is the following

a = sha256(UnixTimestamp) + pepper(UnixTimestamp)
x = sha256(pepper(a + UnixTimestamp))
result = x
