# Standard Socialvoid Objects

While this library has its own set of objects for the
purpose of providing a smooth operating environment,
the standards must still apply to the end user. These
objects are designed to be compatible with the libs
proprietary objects.

## Standard Objects

 - [peer](Peer.php)
   - [peer.profile](Profile/Name.php)
